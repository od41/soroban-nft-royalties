# Soroban NFT Royalties Smart Contracts

This repository hosts smart contracts developed for managing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and their associated royalties on the Stellar Network, particularly for The Blue Marble platform. Our contracts facilitate not only the entitlement of creators but also the distribution of trade revenue to third parties like non-profits or charities.

## Project Status

Our Testnet service is now live and we are anticipating going fully live shortly after the Stellar Soroban Mainnet launch. The contracts herein power NFT functionalities on The Blue Marble and are part of an initiative to foster standardization and cross-compatibility among different NFT platforms on the Stellar Network.

## Contributing

We welcome collaborations from the Stellar Community to enhance interoperability and standardize NFT operations on Stellar.
